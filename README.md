# Poker-Combination-Sorter
Algorithm for sorting poker hands according to their strength

### Project problems
- Code decomposition is not very beautiful
- Code has duplicates
- Too huge for such task
- Code does not check if there card duplicates

### Project advantages
- Universal for poker games, 
  cause we pick only top 5 cards for combination
- Code splitted into functions
- Has interesting ideas of checking combinations
- Algorithms use STL containers
